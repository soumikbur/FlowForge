# FlowForge REST API Contracts

All endpoints return a standardized envelope structure:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... },
  "error": null,
  "meta": { "page": 1, "pageSize": 20, "total": 100 }
}
```

In case of errors:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "data": null,
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_FAILED",
    "message": "Invalid workflow graph",
    "details": [ ... ]
  }
}
```
